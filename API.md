# Documentation of Backend APIs

Note that this document uses pretty-printed JSON for readability,
but you should not rely on that, nor is it necessary for request
payloads to be pretty-printed.

## POST `/v1/add`

Records a new set of career tasks. Expects a JSON payload like this:

    {
      "token": "abc (your token here)",
      "station": "Spirit of New York City, YZ Ceti system",
      "career": "Technologist",
      "rank": "Shipwright",
      "tasks": {
        "Run multiple salvage operations.": "174.00",
        "Market your salvage to Freebooters": "196.00",
        "Expand your business further.": "189.00",
        "Hire a bigger crew.": "189.00",
        "Hire even more illegal employees": "225.00"
      }
    }

In case of success, it returns a payload like this:

    {
        "character": "moritz",
        "factor": 1.0,
        "recorded": true
    }

If an error occurs, the error message is a property called `message`:

    {
        "message": "invalid token",
        "recorded": false
    }

## GET `/v1/stations`

    {
      "data": {

        "character2": 9
      }
    }

## GET `/v1/station-needs-update/<station>`

Returns, for a given station (URL-encoded in the URL), whether an update would make sense.

[Observe it in the wild](https://ctt.tauguide.de/v1/station-needs-update/Spirit%20of%20New%20York%20City%2C%20YZ%20Ceti%20system).

It returns `{"needs_update": true}` if data for this station has been submitted in the last 6 hours, and `{"needs_update": false}` otherwise.
